The data we tested in our video is on a dataset so large that we could not push it to a free GitHub repo, so the results you see will differ from those in the video. 

Dependencies (there could be more): 
pip install prompt_toolkit pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


to run this run main.py if option 2 does not work run train.py

the csv you can use is located in /testCSV/RAW.csv
